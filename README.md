This assignment, as part of The Odin Project, is designed to put into practice some basics of Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript.  

This will also be the first project simulating the storage of a user's data.  After completing further projects, it will likely be a good idea to add more functionality to the storage aspect of this project and make it more realistic.
